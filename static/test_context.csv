As now preserved this repair or reinforcement stands as high as the preserved top of the first wall. 3+ A second oval wall of exactly the same width as the first built of a reddish clayey substance laid in reddish mortar. In the south portion of the square this wall lies directly on top of the first; in the north the two stages are separated by a layer of fill ca. 5 cm thick. The lowest course of the wall is bricks on edge as was the lowest course of the west wall of Locus 3 and Locus 4 and in the south section can be seen to rest on the same ashy layer that took off that wall. This ash layer rises somewhat from east to west so that the bottom of the second oval wall is somewhat higher than the bottom of the west wall of Locus 3 and Locus 4. Just as the west wall of Locus 3 and Locus 4 rose from south to north the second oval wall is higher in the north where it rests on fill above the first oval wall than in the south.  |  3/25/ 90 AM - Mention of break in wall which may be a doorway. This does not appear on the plans so it presumably was a cut. HPDARG  |  4/4/90 PM - Along the south face of the curving wall two wall levels are visible. The lower level ends as the wall extends westward and turns into an ashy area. The upper level continues over the ashy area which was apparently reinforced with reeds as a foundation +reed impressions are visible+ below the upper wall. The ashy fill continues under the wall and is also visible at the northern face of the curving wall.,Brick wall  |  Covered with mud plaster  |  2.05m wide at southwest end located in E26-5  |  One meter below preserved top of wall a course of reeds was identified in the cut face at the south end of the wall  |  Section cut through Wall 2 <SU 7> and Kisu 3 <SU 72> in order to determine their relationship.

As now preserved this repair or reinforcement stands as high as the preserved top of the first wall. 3+ A second oval wall of exactly the same width as the first built of a reddish clayey substance laid in reddish mortar. In the south portion of the square this wall lies directly on top of the first; in the north the two stages are separated by a layer of fill ca. 5 cm thick. The lowest course of the wall is gan<?; likely arabic word> libn as was the lowest course of the west wall of Locus 3 and Locus 4 and in the south section can be seen to rest on the same ashy layer that took off that wall. This ash layer rises somewhat from east to west so that the bottom of the second oval wall is somewhat higher than the bottom of the west wall of Locus 3 and Locus 4.
